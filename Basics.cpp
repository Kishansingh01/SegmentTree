// Segment Trees => We made data structure bcz for range queries questions can be 
// solved very offeciency using segment trees.

Ex=>  Ayyar=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7];
  I have to find the maximum array from 2nd index to 6th 
  index , so, here i am selecting the range . So 
  Time Complexity will be O(r-l)[range betweeen].
